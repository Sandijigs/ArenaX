# 🎮 ArenaX Documentation

## 1. 🏗️ Project Overview

ArenaX is a competitive gaming tournament platform tailored for **amateur gamers**, enabling them to join tournaments, compete, report scores with proof, and receive instant payouts via local payment methods (Stripe, Opay, PalmPay, Bank transfers) and **Stellar blockchain-based payouts**. The platform leverages Stellar’s low-cost, fast, and transparent blockchain to manage tournament prize pools, payouts, and reputation systems, ensuring trust and fairness. Advanced features like real-time matchmaking, AI-driven anti-cheat, and community-driven tournaments enhance scalability and engagement.

**Core Goals**:
- Make **esports accessible** to everyday mobile and console gamers in Nigeria.
- Provide a **secure, fair environment** with advanced anti-cheat, score verification, and Stellar-based transparency.
- Enable **fast, transparent payouts** using local payment systems and Stellar blockchain for verifiable, low-cost transactions.
- Scale to support large-scale tournaments with real-time updates, distributed systems, and Stellar-backed prize pools.

**Stellar Blockchain Focus**:
- Use Stellar for transparent management of tournament prize pools and payouts.
- Issue custom assets on Stellar for in-platform rewards (e.g., ArenaX Tokens).
- Leverage Stellar’s decentralized exchange (SDEX) for converting rewards to local currency (NGN).
- Implement Stellar smart contracts (Soroban) for automated prize distribution and reputation tracking.
